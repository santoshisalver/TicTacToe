# Tic-Tac-Toe Game (Python)

This is a simple **Tic-Tac-Toe** game implemented in Python. The game is played on a 3x3 grid, where two players alternate placing their symbols ('X' or 'O') on the grid. 
The first player to align three of their symbols in a row, column, or diagonal wins the game.

## Features:
- 2-player mode (Player 1 is 'X' and Player 2 is 'O').
- Input validation to prevent invalid moves (e.g., placing a symbol on an already occupied spot).
- The game automatically detects the winner after each move.
- The game announces a winner immediately after a player wins.
- If no player wins after all moves (9 turns), the game results in a draw.
